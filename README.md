## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This Angular library provides two services:
 - CacheService: which interacts directly with the browser local/session storage
 - HttpCacheService: which is a wrapper(decorator) around Angular HttpClient that offers the ability to cache any request that you want to (including post request) and offers the results as a Observable of the desired type, exactly as HttpClient.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
To use this library you should have at least Angular 13. Installation of this library can be done using the following commands, depending on your package manager.

- npm: ```npm i ngx-caching```
- yarn ```yarn add ngx-caching```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The following is a basic usage example of the HttpCacheService:

```typescript
...
import {HttpCacheService} from "ngx-caching";
...

constructor(private configService: ConfigService, private httpCached: HttpCacheService) { }

getValuesByType(typeId: number):Observable<any> {
 return this.httpCached.get(this.configService.getPath('dictionary', 'entries', {typeId}));
}
```
In the above example, the values that will be retrieved will also be cached, so any subsequent subscription to this method will result in a cache look-up rather than another HTTP request.
